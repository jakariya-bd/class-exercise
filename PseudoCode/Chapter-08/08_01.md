Pseudo Code: Linear Regression Calculation

Input:
- n (total number of data points)
- Arrays x and y to store data points

Output:
- m (slope)
- c (intercept)

BEGIN
    Set constant MX to 101
    Declare variables n, x[MX], y[MX], i, total_x, total_y, total_xy, total_x2, m, c

    Display "Enter n: "
    Read n from user

    Display "Enter x_i y_i from 1 to n:"

    FOR i from 1 to n DO
        Read x[i] and y[i] from the user

    Initialize total_x, total_y, total_xy, and total_x2 to 0

    FOR i from 1 to n DO
        total_xy <- total_xy + x[i] * y[i]
        total_x <- total_x + x[i]
        total_y <- total_y + y[i]
        total_x2 <- total_x2 + x[i] * x[i]

    Calculate m as (n * total_xy - total_x * total_y) / (n * total_x2 - total_x * total_x)
    Calculate c as (total_y - m * total_x) / n

    Display "m = ", m
    Display "c = ", c

    Return 0
