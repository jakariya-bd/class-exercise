# class-exercise
I uploaded solution codes only for programming exercises in the book.
If I upload anything else, I will explicitly describe or mention it.
I don't take responisblity if there are any misktakes in my solutions. Because I'm not sure of every solution either.
Please give me feedback and point out any errors you've found out. :)
